 -- Â©Rachel Alcraft 2021, PsuMultivarse --
This class takes an entire matrix of data, and performs interpolation at any point to a given degree
At the chosen point, a local function is calculated based on the degree using  the MultiSolver or PolySolver
If the points are too close to the edge, the degree will be automatically reduced to enable the interpolation
This allows the calculation of derivtives and values of the data

        #2. Then ask for the point from a MultiSolver or PolySolver adjusting it's value to be the centre of the local curve
